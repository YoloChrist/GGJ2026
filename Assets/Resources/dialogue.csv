4 - Ah, another potential business partner...? Eugh, I can look past your questionable dress sense... - What do you mean 'questionable dress sense'!? -- Yes, I am here to do business -- Actually, no. I'm a detective -- No! I'm just here for the party
5 - Did you hear something, darling? - Excuse me... -- May I have a word? -- I'm right here...
A - What are you? A peasant? - End
A Detective - What is a lowly man like you doing here? This is for the high class *only*. - Looking for a killer -- I was invited by the host -- For the free alcohol
A... contract? - Yes. How else do you do business? - I don't... -- I go by word of mouth. -- I ask weird questions
Actually, I changed my mind - What? Insolent. I'll have you fired! - End
Actually, no. I'm a detective - Intriguing... - Can I ask you a few questions? -- Did you do it? -- I know!
Aha! Gotcha! - No you don't! I'm not a criminal! - End
An expert! - Ah, then maybe we can draw up a contract... - A... contract? -- Not so fast... -- I just wanted to ask a few questions, not start a business.
And...? - And I think you should not show up at all next time. Hmph! - End
Anyone else as ugly as me? - Yes. That girl. You're a pair of uglies in a world of perfection. Go away! - End
Are you always this annoying? - No. You are. - End
Are you covering up a murder? - (*gasp*) Insolent peasant! - End
Are you here alone? - (*gasp*) How *rude*. I am *married*. Keep your obscene fantasies to yourself! - End

Because it's the only formal wear I own. - Poor? Then leave. - End
Bennedict, Duke of... Kings... Weed - (*narrows eyes*) Kingsweed? I haven't heard of such a place. - It's a... lesser known dukedom -- That's because I just made it up! -- How dare you!
C - What? Leave me alone. - End
Can I ask you a few questions? - I suppose... - Did you notice anyone arriving late? -- Is there anyone here you find suspicious? -- Do you know the killer?
Can you please tell me who. - All I can say is that they had striking red eyes. Now leave before I lose my patience further. - End
Can you tell me where they are? - Of course not that red eyed peasant is not worth my time. Now go away, you're much the same. - End
D - (*gasp*) Who let *that thing* in? - End
Damn... - What? Got a problem, lowlife! - End
Did anyone arrive noticeably late? - Yes, someone dressed in light blue did. - Thank you
Did anyone show up late? - Yes. - You give such long answers... -- Just describe them -- Great!
Did anyone stick out? - Yes. This one clearly wasn't raised right. He seems to favour his solitude and dismisses others rudely. And you're too nosy - End
Did you do it? - Do what? - The thing -- The murder -- Drink all the champagne
Did you notice anyone arriving late? - Yes... that guest with blue hair. Untrustworthy. Why do you need to know that!? Are they your business partner!? Lowlife scum! - End
Did you notice if anyone arrived late? - Yes. - Who? -- Can you tell me where they are? -- And...?
Do you know the killer? - I don't deal with such lowlifes and the fact you think so is insulting! - End
Do you know their name? - Of course not. I wouldn't associate with such peasantry. (*scoff*) Like you. - End
Don't ignore me! - Oh, shut up! - Just let me ask you a question. -- You get off your high horse! -- Finally!
Drink all the champagne - Well... it might be possible... - Aha! Gotcha! -- Ok, I'm joking, I want to ask different questions -- Might? Did you really drink that much?
E - Hmph. - End
End - Conversation ended - Aristocrat Selection
Ew to you too! - (*scoff*) - End
Ew? - (*turns away*) - End
Exactly! - Ugh, you're insufferable. - End
Excuse me... - Did you hear that Patricia get engaged? - Hello!? -- Don't ignore me! -- May I have a word?
F - Get me another drink, lowlife. - End
Finally! - What? - Just let me ask you a question. -- Now we can talk. -- Are you always this annoying?

Hello! - Insolent. - End
Hello!? - She is such a bratty young lady... - I give up. -- You're the brat!
Hey! - I speak the truth. - End
How dare you! - Uh... My apologies? But if you are not recognisable, why are you here? - I was invited by the host -- Looking for a killer -- For the free alcohol
How rude! - Are you not? Why dress the part? - You have no manners! -- It's my *style* -- Because it's the only formal wear I own.
I - How dare you! - End
I am! - Then get lost. - End
I ask weird questions - Intriguing... Like what? - Did you notice anyone arriving late? -- Is there anyone here you find suspicious? -- Do you know the killer?
I don't want a contract! - Then I don't want to continue this conversation! - End
I don't... - Liar! I can't trust you enough! - End
I give up. - I never like her... - End
I go by word of mouth. - What a terrible way to do it! You're not worth my time! - End
I just need some information - What kind? - Did anyone arrive noticeably late? -- Is there anyone out of place? -- Are you here alone?
I just wanted to ask a few questions, not start a business. - Well... So long as it's not about my business secrets... - Did you notice anyone arriving late? -- Is there anyone here you find suspicious? -- Do you know the killer?
I know! - Not so humble... Know your place! - End
I make up for my incompetence with personality! - Oh, you're one of those. - Yes! -- No I'm not! -- What's that supposed to mean?
I want a talk - No, thank you. - End
I was invited by the host - We are were, idiot. What makes you special? - I'm a detective -- I'm rich! -- I'm not special
I wasn't... - Begon! - End
I'd like a moment of your time - Why should I give you that? - I'm rich! -- I'd like to ask a few questions -- You already are

I'm a detective - A what? Why are you here really? - Looking for a killer -- For the free alcohol -- I just need some information
I'm actually a detective - No wonder you look like that. - End
I'm actually the Duke of... Uh... Farland - Farland? That doesn't exists. - It does! -- You're right, I'm lying -- That's besides the point
I'm looking for someone. - Oh, likewise, perhaps you are that person. How good are you in business? - No... you're definitely not who I'm looking for... -- An expert! -- So bad that I work for someone else!
I'm not special - Then go away! - End
I'm rich! - Tch... And not humble. - End
I'm right here... - No? Me neither. - May I have a word? -- Excuse me... -- Don't ignore me!
In return can I ask a few questions? - I suppose. - Have you spoken to everyone here? -- Is there anyone you don't recognise? -- Did anyone show up late?
Is it not? - No! Fool! - End
Is there anyone here you find suspicious? - Hmm... Yes, that guest with blue hair. I don't trust them... Do you? Even considering a lowlife such as that makes you one of them! How could I think you were anything worth my time! - End
Is there anyone out of place? - Well, there is someone not adhering to the dress code... besides you. - What do they look like? -- Where are they? -- Do you know their name?
Is there anyone suspicious? - You, for one. And this girl. Never heard of her before yet they're here. Don't pry about into our business. - End
Is there anyone you don't know well? - Yes. There was this girl. They're a new face from an unknown land. And you. Peasant. - End
Is there anyone you don't recognise? - Yes. Why? - Uh... research... -- I'm actually a detective -- Just describe them
It does! - Don't play me for a fool! - End
It's a... lesser known dukedom - (*scoff*) Then stop talking to me, peasant. - End
It's champagne - Uh, close enough. - In return can I ask a few questions? -- Is it not? -- It's red wine
It's my *style* - It's a peasant's style. - I'm actually a detective -- I'd like to ask you a few questions -- Well aren't you pleasant
It's red wine - Yes. Good. Now go get it! - In return can I ask a few questions? -- Got it!
It's sparkling water - (*scoff*) Tonight is not a night for water! - End
Just a curious guest - (*scoff*) Aren't we all. What is it you're curious about? - I just need some information -- You
Just describe them - Insolent. - End
Just great... - Anyway... Darling, what were you saying? - End
Just humour me... - Fine. - Did you notice anyone arriving late? -- Is there anyone here you find suspicious? -- Do you know the killer?
Just let me ask you a question. - Get it over with. - Did you notice if anyone arrived late? -- Are you ignoring anyone else? -- Why are you so rude?
Just... checking... - Red wine! Idiot. - In return can I ask a few questions? -- Got it!
Looking for a killer - (*gasp*) You can't say such uncouth things! We certainly aren't the sort! How dare you accuse us! - I wasn't... -- I just need some information
May I have a word? - (*sigh*) I suppose - Just let me ask you a question. -- Are you always this annoying? -- Now we can talk.
Maybe? - Maybe not. Go away! - End
Might? Did you really drink that much? - Potentially... - Damn... -- You must be drunk... -- Ok, I'm joking, I want to ask different questions
Neither do I, but I still want to find them! - Ugh, fine. All I can say is that they had striking red eyes. Now you can go join them. - End
No I'm not! - Get some self-awareness. - End
No! - Insolent! - End
No! I'm just here for the party - No one comes here for the party, they always have a motive (*narrows eyes*) - I'm looking for someone. -- I am! -- Well, you're not wrong...
No... you're definitely not who I'm looking for... - Then so be it! - End
Not as ugly as that dress - (*scoff*) It's worth more than you are, not that you amount to much. - End
Not so fast... - Right, of course, wait until after the party to avoid prying ears. - You are not getting this... -- Sure... -- I don't want a contract!
Now we can talk. - As if. - End
Of course not! - Oh... Are you not interested in me!? Then get lost! - End
Ok, I lied, I'm here to ask you some questions - Trying to steal my secrets?! - Of course not! -- They're not about business -- Just humour me...
Ok, I'm joking, I want to ask different questions - Oh? - Did you notice anyone arriving late? -- Is there anyone here you find suspicious? -- Do you know the killer?
Ok, well, can I still ask you a few questions? - Potentially... - Did you notice anyone arriving late? -- Is there anyone here you find suspicious? -- Do you know the killer?
Right away! - Make it quick. - In return can I ask a few questions? -- What would you like? -- Actually, I changed my mind
Right, of course... - You *do* remember. Right? - No! -- It's champagne -- It's red wine -- It's sparkling water
Rude! - I think you'll find you're the rude one! - End
So bad that I work for someone else! - Oh... a common worker... Get out of my way! - End
Sure... - (*narrows eyes*) You have no clue what I'm talking about, do you!? Get lost! - End
THE thing - What are you talking about!? - The murder -- Drink all the champagne -- You know...
Thank you - You've had enough of my time. I can't sully myself anymore by associating with you. - End
That I'm not here for starting a business. - Tch, get lost then.. - End
That you're stupid! - Get lost, lowlife! - End
That's because I just made it up! - How rude! Do you take me for a fool! - End
That's besides the point - Then what is the point? - I'd like to ask you a few questions -- I want a talk -- You look dashing tonight
The King - What a ridiculous statement. Begon! - End
The murder - What!? How rude to assume that! - End
The thing - What thing? - The thing -- You know... -- THE thing
There goes my self-esteem - Are you that sensitive? You aren't worthy of my time. - End
They're not about business - Then get lost! - End
Uh, no, I'm not staff - Then leave this establishment. - End
Uh... ok? - Fool! Why would you sign without question! I can't work with someone so weak-minded! - End
Uh... research... - I am not something to be studied! - End
Uh... which is? - Are you that forgetful?! - Uh, no, I'm not staff -- Yes. -- Just... checking...
Unfortunately... - Hmph, not worth my time then. - End
Well aren't you pleasant - Insolent! - End
Well, you're not wrong... - Precisely. I never am. Now, down to business. Just sign this contract... - What? No! -- Uh... ok? -- Ok, I lied, I'm here to ask you some questions
What do they look like? - They had a light blue outfit. But you aren't well dressed either. I've had enough of humouring the peasants. - End
What do you mean 'questionable dress sense'!? - Look at you... I think I made myself quite clear. - Rude! -- Ok, well, can I still ask you a few questions? -- There goes my self-esteem
What would you like? - The usual. - Uh... which is? -- Right, of course...
What's that supposed to mean? - Your lack of education is showing. - End
What? No! - Then get lost! No need to be so rude, lowlife. - End
Where are they? - I don't know. Stop interrogating me! - End
Who? - I don't know them. - Can you tell me where they are? -- Just great... -- Neither do I, but I still want to find them!
Why are you so rude? - Because people like you exist. - End
Why the adverse reaction? - You're... Ugly. - Hey! -- Anyone else as ugly as me? -- Not as ugly as that dress
Yes! - At least you own it... - I just wanted to ask a few questions, not start a business. -- Exactly! -- Unfortunately...
Yes, I am here to do business - Perfect! How good are you at business? - An expert! -- So bad that I work for someone else! -- Average...
Yes. - Insolent. I'll have you fired! - End
You - Well I have no interest in you. - End
You already are - No more. - End
You are not getting this... - Getting what? - I just wanted to ask a few questions, not start a business. -- That you're stupid! -- That I'm not here for starting a business.
You come here often? - Tch. Yes, and you don't. - End
You do - I don't. Stop wasting my time! - End
You get off your high horse! - Hmph. Anyway... Darling, what were you saying? - End
You give such long answers... - Insolent! - End
You have no manners! - Neither do you! - End
You know... - I don't... - The murder -- Drink all the champagne -- You do
You look dashing tonight - (*narrows eyes*) You don't. - End
You must be drunk... - A tad... Oh, is that the Duke of Rudder, I must speak with him! - End
You're right, I'm lying - Insolent peasant! - End
You're the brat! - I never like her... - End
start - You’re a detective following a murder case and the suspect was spotted running into a masquerade ball. However, due to the urgency of the case, you got little to no information on them and have just been told to track them down. So, you enter to the scrutinising looks of the aristocrats around you. They know you’re not supposed to be there, and they know the suspect is an outsider as well. Can you deduce who is out of place without getting kicked out yourself? - End
